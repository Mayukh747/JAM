Hey Prof!

I would like to propose a team of 3 (myself, James Jian and Andrew Townsend) for the semester project. 
We intend to simulate an algorithm (weâ€™re still debating between MSA and phylogenetic tree) and come up 
with an aesthetic and presentable UI with animations as well as possible a backend API to handle processing input.

I hope a project of such scale captures your attention, and would like to hear back from you regarding your approval
 as well as any feedback you might have.

Thanks in advance,

- different style/background profiles --> This may involve a prop or another entry in the array we already pass to it

Alignment algorithm:



MSA:
- Compute optimal alignment between each sequence pair
- Calculate OPTIMAL distances for each alignment pair and put them into a matrix
    - Question: How do the difference scores between optimal alignments vary? 
- I think this will require solving the distances while solving the table, otherwise the programming
part of it seems to become a mess
    I just want one alignment when I'm done.

NCBI:
- find a way to retrieve fasta sequeces according to some user input like an accession number
- introduce a manual sleep so that we don't get timeouts from the api requests
